# open_stage_modlity
   
   This project is a proof of concept (pre a connecting the Supercollider lib/quark modality to open stage controle.  The goal is to give supercollider the ability to read open stage controles files and generate a modality definition that matches . I was also able to read open stage controles (file)/state over OSC and generate a Modality file in that way. 

        Not all open stage controle widgets match well to Modality.  Widgets such as text,Image,Htmlâ€¦  Helper classes or functions  would be needed.

       If you are inspired feel free to help or contribute in any way.
