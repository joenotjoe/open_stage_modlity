# open_stage_modlity
   
   This project is a proof of concept. Connecting the Supercollider lib/quark modality to Open Stage Control.  The goal is to give supercollider the ability to read Open Stage Control files and generate a Modality definition that matches . I was also able to read Open Stage Control file over OSC and generate a Modality file in that way. 

   Not all Open Stage Control widgets match well to Modality.  Widgets such as text,Image,Htmlâ€¦ 
Helper classes or functions would be needed. If you are inspired feel free to help or contribute in any way.
